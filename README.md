### What is this application and what does it do?
This tool is designed to convert timestamped subtitles generated by applications like [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sanchit-gandhi/whisper-jax) into the widely used SRT format. The program does not create subtitles on its own; it only converts Whisper-JAX and similar format outputs to SRT format. It does not convert VTT or other formats to SRT (these features may be added in future updates).

### Features
- Easy to use interface
